# dcAudioGraph
An audio/control processing graph for use in interactive sound software.

**Please note: this library is currently in heavy, early development. Many things may change on the `dev` branch without warning, and backward compatibility is not guaranteed. If you want to work with something somewhat stable, pull the `master` branch.**

## Dependencies
* **None!*** 

**(unless you count the C++ standard library)*

## Prerequisites
* A C++14-compatible compiler.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the contents of the subfolder `dcAudioGraph` to your project
3. `#include "dcAudioGraph.h"`

Alternatively, you could build it as a static library. See the vs2017 project for an example of how to do that.

## Contributing
Yes please! Help is super appreciated. 

Get in touch with Charlie ([@charliehuge](https://twitter.com/charlieHUGE)) if you'd like to help improve the library.

If you find a bug, please file an issue or submit a pull request.

TLDR: It's yours, for free. Don't say we never gave you nothing. *Also, don't say we endorse what you do with it in any way.*

One request: if you use the library, let me know!

Ok, two requests, actually: if you use the library and end up fixing something in it, please share your fixes!
