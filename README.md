# dcAudioGraph
An audio/control processing graph for use in interactive sound software.

## Dependencies
**None!** *(unless you count the C++ standard library)*

## Prerequisites
* A C++14-compatible compiler.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the contents of the subfolder `dcAudioGraph` to your project
3. `#include "dcAudioGraph.h"`

Alternatively, you could build it as a static library. See the vs2017 project for an example of how to do that.

TLDR: It's yours, for free. Don't say I never gave you nothing. *Also, don't say I endorse what you do with it in any way.*

One request: if you use the library, let me know!
Ok, two requests, actually: if you use the library and end up fixing something in it, please share your fixes!
